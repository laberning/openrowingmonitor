  Open Rowing Monitor, https://github.com/laberning/openrowingmonitor

  The Rowing Engine models the physics of a real rowing boat.
  It takes impulses from the flywheel of a rowing machine and estimates
  parameters such as energy, stroke rates and movement.

  This implementation uses concepts that are described here:
  Physics of Rowing by Anu Dudhia: http://eodg.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/dudhia/rowing/physics
  Also Dave Vernooy has some good explanations here: https://dvernooy.github.io/projects/ergware
