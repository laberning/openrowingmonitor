Open Rowing Monitor uses some great work by others. Thank you for all the great resources that helped me to make this project possible. I especially would like to thank:

* A lot of helpful information for building the physics engine of the rowing machine was found in this scientific work by Anu Dudhia: [The Physics of Ergometers](http://eodg.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/dudhia/rowing/physics/ergometer.html).

* Dave Vernooy's project description on [ErgWare](https://dvernooy.github.io/projects/ergware) has some good information on the maths involved in a rowing ergometer.

* Nomath has done a very impressive [Reverse engineering of the actual workings of the Concept 2 PM5](https://www.c2forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=194719), including experimentally checking drag calculations.

* Bluetooth is quite a complex beast, luckily the Bluetooth SIG releases all the [Bluetooth Specifications](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs).

* The app icon is based on this [Image of a rowing machine](https://thenounproject.com/term/rowing-machine/659265) by [Gan Khoon Lay](https://thenounproject.com/leremy/) licensed under [CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/).
