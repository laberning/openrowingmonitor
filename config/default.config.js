  This file contains the default configuration of the Open Rowing Monitor.

  !!! Note that changes to this file will be OVERWRITTEN when you update to a new version
  of Open Rowing Monitor. !!!

  To change the settings you should modify the 'config/config.js' file. Simply copy the
  options that you would like to change into that file. If 'config.js' does not exist, you
  can use the example file from the 'install' folder.

  // Type of flank: what flank should be detected by the GPIO detection?
  // Valid values are 'Up' for the upward flank, 'Down' for the downward flank, 'Both' for both flanks

  // a specific flank might provide better filtering capabilities.

  // due to bouncing reed switches etc., which typically are detected as very short measurements in the raw logs.
  // Making this too long results in missed impulses. Both can be detected in the raw logs easily.
  // Normal value is 50 us, but for some rowers, values up to 500 us are known to work.
