  This file contains the rower specific settings for different models of ergometers.

  These have been generated by the community. If your rower is not listed here and you did find
  good settings for your rowing device please send them to us (together with a raw recording of
  10 strokes) so we can add the device here.

    numOfImpulsesPerRevolution: 1,

    // How big the sprocket is that attaches your belt/chain to your flywheel. This determines both the force on the handle
    // as well as the drive length. If all goes well, you end up with average forces around 400 to 800 N and drive lengths around 1.20 to 1.35 m
    sprocketRadius: 7.0,

    // NOISE FILTER SETTINGS
    // Filter Settings to reduce noise in the measured data
    // Minimum and maximum duration between impulses in seconds during active rowing. Measurements above the maximum are filtered, so setting these liberaly
    // might help here

    // Smoothing determines the length of the running average for filtering the currentDt, 1 effectively turns it off
    smoothing: 1,

    // STROKE DETECTION SETTINGS
    // Flank length determines the minimum number of consecutive increasing/decreasing measuments that are needed before the stroke detection
    // considers a drive phase change
    flankLength: 3,

    // This is the minimum force that has to be on the handle before ORM considers it a stroke, in Newtons. So this is about 2 Kg or 4.4 Lbs.
    minumumForceBeforeStroke: 20,

    // The minimal inclination of the currentDt's before it is considered a recovery. When set to 0, it will look for a pure increase/decrease
    minumumRecoverySlope: 0,

    // The minimum quality level of the stroke detection: 1.0 is perfect, 0.1 pretty bad. Normally around 0.33. Setting this too high will stop
    // the recovery phase from being detected.
    minimumStrokeQuality: 0.34,

    // ORM can automatically calculate the recovery slope and adjust it dynamically. For this to work, autoAdjustDragFactor MUST be set to true
    autoAdjustRecoverySlope: false,

    // The margin used between the automatically calculated recovery slope and a next recovery. Don't touch unless you know what you are doing.
    autoAdjustRecoverySlopeMargin: 0.05,

    // Error reducing settings for the rowing phase detection (in seconds)
    minimumDriveTime: 0.300, // minimum time of the drive phase
    minimumRecoveryTime: 0.900, // minimum time of the recovery phase

    // Needed to determine the drag factor of the rowing machine. This value can be measured in the recovery phase
    // of the stroke.
    // To display it for your rowing machine, set the logging level of the RowingEngine to 'info'. Then start rowing and
    // you will see the measured values in the log.
    // Just as a frame of reference: the Concept2 can display this factor from the menu, where it is multiplied with 1.000.000
    // For a new Concept2 the Drag Factor ranges between 80 (Damper setting 1) and 220 (Damper setting 10). Other rowers are
    // in the range of 150 to 450 (NordicTrack).
    // Open Rowing Monitor can also automatically adjust this value based on the measured damping. To do so, set the setting
    // autoAdjustDragFactor to true (see below).
    dragFactor: 1500,

    // Set this to true, if you want to automatically update the drag factor based on the measured
    // values in the stroke recovery phase. If your rower produces stable damping values, then this could be a good
    // option to dynamically adjust your measurements to the damper setting of your rower.
    // When your machine's power and speed readings are too volatile it is wise to turn it off
    autoAdjustDragFactor: false,

    // If autoAdjustDragFactor is set to true, it will calculate the drag each recovery phase and update it accordingly to calculate speed,
    // distance, etc.. As this calculation that is prone to noise in the measuremnts, it is wise to apply smoothing to prevent this noise
    // from throwing off your key metrics. The default value is a running average of the drag factor of 5 strokes
    dragFactorSmoothing: 5,

    // When drag is calculated, we also get a quality indication. Based on this quality indication (1.0 is best, 0.1 pretty bad), low quality
    // drag factors are rejected to prevent drag poisoning
    minimumDragQuality: 0.83,

    // The moment of inertia of the flywheel kg*m^2
    // A way to measure it is outlined here: https://dvernooy.github.io/projects/ergware/, "Flywheel moment of inertia"
    // You could also roughly estimate it by just doing some strokes and the comparing the calculated power values for
    // plausibility. Note that the power also depends on the drag factor (see above).
    flywheelInertia: 0.5,

    // The time before a stroke is considered paused
    maximumStrokeTimeBeforePause: 6.0,

    // A constant that is commonly used to convert flywheel revolutions to a rowed distance
    // see here: http://eodg.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/dudhia/rowing/physics/ergometer.html#section9
    // Concept2 seems to use 2.8, which they admit is an arbitrary number which came close
    // to their expectations. So for your rower, you have to find a plausible distance for your effort.
    // Also note that the rowed distance also depends on flywheelInertia, so please calibrate that before changing this constant.
    // PLEASE NOTE: Increasing this number decreases your rowed meters
    magicConstant: 2.8
