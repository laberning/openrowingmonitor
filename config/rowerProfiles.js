  This file contains the rower specific settings for different models of ergometers.

  These have been generated by the community. If your rower is not listed here and you did find
  good settings for your rowing device please send them to us (together with a raw recording of
  10 strokes) so we can add the device here.

    // Filter Settings to reduce noise in the measured data
    // Minimum and maximum duration between impulses in seconds during active rowing. Measurements outside of this range
    // are replaced by a default value.

    // STROKE DETECTION SETTINGS
    // Flank length determines the minimum number of consecutive increasing/decreasing measuments that are needed before the stroke detection
    // considers a drive phase change

    numberOfErrorsAllowed: 0,

    // Natural deceleration is used to distinguish between a powered and unpowered flywheel.
    // This must be a NEGATIVE number and indicates the level of deceleration required to interpret it as a free spinning
    // flywheel. The best way to find the correct value for your rowing machine is a try and error approach.
    // You can also set this to zero (or positive), to use the more robust, but not so precise acceleration-based stroke
    // detection algorithm.
    naturalDeceleration: 0,

    // Error reducing settings for the rowing phase detection (in seconds)
    maximumImpulseTimeBeforePause: 3.0, // maximum time between impulses before the rowing engine considers it a pause
    minimumDriveTime: 0.300, // minimum time of the drive phase
    minimumRecoveryTime: 1.200, // minimum time of the recovery phase

    // Needed to determine the drag factor of the rowing machine. This value can be measured in the recovery phase
    // of the stroke.
    // To display it for your rowing machine, set the logging level of the RowingEngine to 'info'. Then start rowing and
    // you will see the measured values in the log.
    // Just as a frame of reference: the Concept2 can display this factor from the menu, where it is multiplied with 1.000.000
    // For a new Concept2 the Drag Factor ranges between 80 (Damper setting 1) and 220 (Damper setting 10). Other rowers are
    // in the range of 150 to 450 (NordicTrack).
    // Open Rowing Monitor can also automatically adjust this value based on the measured damping. To do so, set the setting
    // autoAdjustDampingConstant to true (see below).

    // The moment of inertia of the flywheel kg*m^2
    // A way to measure it is outlined here: https://dvernooy.github.io/projects/ergware/, "Flywheel moment of inertia"
    // You could also roughly estimate it by just doing some strokes and the comparing the calculated power values for
    // plausibility. Note that the power also depends on the drag factor (see above).
    flywheelInertia: 0.5,

    // Set this to true, if you want to automatically update the drag factor based on the measured
    // values in the stroke recovery phase. If your rower produces stable damping values, then this could be a good
    // option to dynamically adjust your measurements to the damper setting of your rower.
    // When your machine's power and speed readings are too volatile it is wise to turn it off
    autoAdjustDampingConstant: false,

    // A constant that is commonly used to convert flywheel revolutions to a rowed distance
    // see here: http://eodg.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/dudhia/rowing/physics/ergometer.html#section9
    // Concept2 seems to use 2.8, which they admit is an arbitrary number which came close
    // to their expectations. So for your rower, you have to find a credible distance for your effort.
    // Also note that the rowed distance also depends on jMoment, so please calibrate that before changing this constant.
    // PLEASE NOTE: Increasing this number decreases your rowed meters
